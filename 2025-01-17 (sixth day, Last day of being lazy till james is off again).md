I forced my self to start getting some stuff today, I am getting my self getting back warmed up for tomorrow. I plan on doing some more JS tomorrow, I believe this is how im going to do my cycles, when james works, so do I. When he is off I will take my days off while still writing short daily notes, and doing some learning if I am feeling up to it. 

I got some concerning news today in the form of learning that my mom needs a double knee replacement, it is slightly concerning due to the fact that my grandpa died due to complications of the surgery(Not keeping the wound clean). So on that aspect, its not as much of a worry, I just need to make sure mom is taking care of the wound, which possibly may be challenging, but she will do it. But I know that if she has this done she will be all the better for it, and will most likely have better knees then I do at 23. I see my self having to have the same surgery at some point. Mom seems ever more keen on her big move to James and my home, Im getting more stressed and excited by the day. I know that me and my family will be all the better and more prosperous for doing so. As I write these notes about the impending event, I feel better, due to me being able to process these emotions.

I have noticed that my lingering anger is showing back through and I need to get it back under control. I realized today that my anger stems of stress and annoyance, which ends up being taken out on James where it isnt deserved, even if some days he does irritate me. Every day is a chance to grow past the anger and stress that I deal with, when I get to working in a couple of months the money stress will be gone away and ill even get to choose my own schedule, which is wonderful. things will be better soon

On a positive note, I have really been enjoying the all of create mod pack on minecraft, when I can actually enjoy a game instead of just being on auto pilot is very nice, its a much needed feeling. This only happens every few months and when it does happen is amazing. I think I also want to listen to some new music, and maybe start making some music again, its very therapeutic for me I've noticed.

on that note, I will be ending this note, I am happy to have wrote this note, it makes me feel like I am still on track, and im feeling more motivated, each time I write these, I get a bubble of clarity and thought. I love the feeling of this, I feel like I am really sticking to something, I set a goal of doing this for a whole year and really feel like it is possible
