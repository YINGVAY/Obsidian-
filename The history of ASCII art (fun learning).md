**Origins of ascii art

ASCII (American standard code for information interchange) is a character encoding standard established in 1963. It represents text using numbers (0-127), mapping these to characters like letters, numbers, and symbols. Computing in the 1960s and 1970s, lacked computers with advanced graphical interfaces, so they relied on text based screens or printers to display information. ASCII art arose as a way to create images or designs using only text characters. ASCII art has roots in even earlier typewriter art, where artists used manual typewriters to create intricate designs with typed letters and symbols. ASCII art became common in printouts to add visual elements to otherwise dry technical documents. 

**The golden age of ASCII Art

Bulletin board systems (BBS) in the 1980s, became a hub for ASCII art. Users and sysadmins used ASCII to create logos, banners, and decorations for BBS homepages. Since bandwidth was limited, ASCII art was lightweight and easily transmitted. There are groups like ANSI that elevated ASCII to a competitive art form. As computers advanced, so did ASCII art. In the demoscence (a subculture of programmers, artists, and musicians), ASCII and ANSI art became a prominent form of creative expression. Artists pushed the limits of what could be done with just characters and colors.

**Modern ASCII Art

We can use tools like figlet and jp2a to locally create ascii art. There are terminal games like nethack, and screensavers like cmatrix to keep ascii alive and well. Modern foss projects often integrate ASCII for retro aesthetics or lightweight solutions.

**Why ascii art matters

ASCII art embodies the spirit of creativity and resourcefulness in computing. It reminds us of a time when limitations bred innovation and art flourished in the most unexpected places, like on the screens and printers of early computers.
