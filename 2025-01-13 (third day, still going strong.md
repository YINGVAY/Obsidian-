I feel as if things are already getting a little bit better, my mental health has been pretty good today, all things considered. I was able to actually start doing my daily schedule that I set yesterday. Normally I would never have the initiative to get up out of bed and start cleaning, if only a little bit. But today I did, and it felt very nice. I messed up on starting work today, which I will be making my self do tomorrow. I think I may write one more note today about what my first "work" will be. Ive got a feeling it will be a new language, like JavaScript. 

I was also able to cook my self dinner from within my home for the first time since we moved into the new house. I was a great feeling, I made bratwurst, peppers, and onions. Its not the best food I have ever cooked, but it felt very rewarding to cook and eat a meal in my own home after not being able to. So it made it all worth it.

The only thing that somewhat ruined the joy I had to be able to cook in my own home, was the fact that I learned that my father had stolen the breaker out of the panel in fears that I would burn the house down. Even though I attended a year of residential electricity school. He has costed me thousands in charcoal and eating out due to his lies about us needing to buy a breaker. He has had every opportunity to put the breaker back in and allow us to use the stove, and he didnt until my mother cornered him up, I cant believe he would treat his son this way...

I woke up this morning around 6AM with a very complex nightmare. I had a dream that I was at a bike rally and someone who was familiar to me, not a friend of family, was seriously hurt. Everyone was simply standing around ignoring the injury this person had. I ran up and screamed for help and then everyone started actually helped. Then it flashed to me seeing from his point of view as he kept eating and vomiting. It was very strange.

I then went back to sleep for an hour where I had another odd dream where I was walking through a store and a stranger knocked a speaker over into my leg, I wasnt fully injured, but it did hurt. And I confronted the man and he threatened to hurt me, another person came over and started mediating the issue me and the man were having. I really dont know what caused these dreams.

I asked chatGPT for a interpretation of my dreams, and it said that this could be a sign of anxiety and always having to be the strong person in bad situations. Which I find to ring true especially with the situation I am currently going through with my mother leaving my father. When I look at my dream in this way, I feel better about it. 

as I write this, Ive actually been feeling inspired to learn new things and continue with my note taking. It feels healthy to get my feelings onto the notes and process these emotions I have bottled up.
