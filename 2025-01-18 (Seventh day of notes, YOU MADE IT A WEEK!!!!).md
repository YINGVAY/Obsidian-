This is a very early in the day note, Im in a weird head-space where I feel floaty and a little anxious, it feels as if I am just existing today, and thats all, I feel very uninspired and eerily calm, its a strange comfort, Learning almost feels impossible on days like this, I keep wanting to indulge in playing video games and relaxing for another day, The key reason for these notes was simply to get my feelings on the page each day for a year, which I am now 7 days into. 

I think today will be a small celebration of making it 7 days, Ive never been able to keep my self honest doing things like this, much less make it a whole week. I am glad that I have made it this far, and am looking forward to writing more notes. Especially when summer comes and I have more things to do each day. I have just gotten to a point where all of my days run together and things are just very slow, The seasonal depression is getting to me, but the light at the end of the tunnel keeps me moving along. I really dont want to spend any more summers in kentucky, Its getting very annoying spending 3-4 months in my home without and real source of joy or inspiration. Though I do learn a lot in these times about my self, I am alone with my thoughts for longer than I really need to be, Its not good for me I dont believe.

It has occurred to me now that when I am in these phases of weird depression that my writing gets very skewed in readability, so if anyone ever reads these, please forgive the lack of proper punctuation and run-on sentences. But I believe not skewing how things are wrote through all of this besides spelling errors will really show how these things get to your head. I can only call these episodes a prison of my own home, these walls get hard to look at after months of staring of them, I really just want to be fishing and riding my motorcycle at these times, whenever it is warm enough to go outside, its like a weight lifted off of my shoulders, thats the only way to describe it. My motorcycle is my only saving grace, it has helped me to not pull that trigger multiple times, it was the greatest blessing god ever gave me, Its like he knew I needed the adrenaline to keep me sane. I think he also sent me james to keep my mind clear and to have something to keep on pushing for, I know if I ever decided to make a exit from this world he wouldnt be too far behind me, and that man deserves to live and thrive. All of these things will get better as time passes by. These thoughts will leave again as the days get warmer and I can go riding again, You can chase the dragon again soon deacon.

I really did not expect the seventh days note to get as dark as it is, but I told my self that I would put my honest thoughts into these daily notes and not manipulate or change things. As I sit here and write this very paragraph I keep finding my self questioning what I am doing, Im really not sure either. It feels like the rambling of a mad man at this point. tomorrow will be a new and fresh day, just keep pushing along and dont let this shit get to your head, only a another month of bitter cold and then you can get back up on nova and make all of these problems leave. 

I think thats all for today, my mind is racing at this point and continuing this note may not be the best at this point.
