Today has been one of those days where I feel like I am breaking promise to my self, but I know break days are always a needed evil. If I were to continue through today I feel like progress would have slowed down to a halt like the last times. I think today was a somewhat positive change to my daily routine, everybody needs "cheat days". I need to make sure I dont beat my self up for this too awful bad, everyone has off days. 

**on to the fun stuff

I played a bunch of minecraft with my friends and learned more about the create mod, ive been drill for thousands of blocks and its a lot of fun. I think I will be going to bed here soon, I just wanted to at least get a small note in, Its very challenging to get 500 words out tonight, when I write these notes, I really need to be doing it while either deafened or out of a call, we will keep that in mind for future notes. I dont really have anything to say about today other than it was somewhat wasted, I could have at least learned something new today. Tomorrow will be productive though, I wont give my self an option for it not to be.
