**Things I wanted clarification on

```html
<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
```

`<li>` Stands for a list item, like all html tags it must be wrapped on both sides

`<a href="">` Stands for anchor and is used to create hyperlinks

`href` is used to specify the URL or location it will be accessing

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

`link` Is a tag that we use to link external resources to our HTML

`rel="stylesheet` tells us what the relationship between the HTML file and the resource, in this case, Its our style-sheet

`href="styles.css"` Is giving us the URL or path to the CSS file 

**This note will be a work in progress as I build my website and get it posted to neocities!

so far I have some chatGPT boiler plate made up and intend on getting things functional tomorrow and then start working on getting it prettied up
