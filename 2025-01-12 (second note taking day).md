I think that I will be using this feature as a general journal/diary. I believe it will be a healthy way to get my thoughts out and fully understand what they mean, and start processing them.

Ive been a little on edge today with everything going on in my family. It appears that my father has been scraping money off the top when I have him run to the store or get me and my fiance food. Just today he claimed I shorted him the cash for the mortgage, wish is most likely not the case. Just like how the other day I only needed 40$ worth of things, and he brought back 50$ out of the 100$ that I had gave him. I found this suspicious. He will soon regret what he is doing when I finally am able to pull mom from his money grubbing grips. She deserves better

In brighter news, I decided to make my first good note about something I learned, The suck-less project, I think that software is kinda junky, but it was good to learn about. I know have a deeper understanding about what makes that software division interesting. but as I said in my write up, I am not the biggest fan of it. I think tomorrow I will start learning more about Gentoo, as now I am daily driving it for my resolution. I really plan on forcing my self to stay with this resolution and keep it going. This will be a good thing.

I set my set up google calendar today containing the things that I need to do each day. I really need to stick to my schedule, I believe with my autism this could be a very good thing for my mental health, and my stability. When I spoke to my friend lactose, she was having very similar issues as me. Not keeping up with regular hygiene and being able to stick to doing things. It was very relieving to be able to have someone that I can relate too. As this really shows that autism is most likely what I am dealing with in some form or fashion.

Mom seems to be in decent spirits about her moving in with James and me. She is sick and tired of dealing with the constant abuse she receives from my father on a daily basis, I feel so bad for her. Just the other day, She prioritized another woman over her, and was ready to let my mom wade through snow and ice to walk to work given she could not find a ride. It was simply unbelievable. How could you treat your wife this way? He is the most shallow person I know, who only cares about money and drugs, Yet still believes he has some sort of moral high-ground over my mother and I. 

Over all, today was pretty successful, I went to the store as well. The little big of social interaction I had seemed to be very beneficial to my on edge behaviors today. It seems that I am a introvert that has the needs of a extrovert. Which is somewhat funny, A oxymoron.

You got this Deacon, keep up the good work and keep to your schedule!!!!
