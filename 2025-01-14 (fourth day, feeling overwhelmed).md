Well, this is very early in the day for me to be making a daily note, but im having the thoughts about wanting to stop what im doing and find something else to do. Ive struggled with this for years, I spoke to chatGPT about it, and it recommended that I celebrated the small victory of making it this far, as what I am doing is tough if this is the usual cycle that I have been stuck in. I really want to be able to make this work, but I am feeling very unmotivated today, I really just don't know what to do besides put my faith in god and keep going.

It seems like every-time I speak with my father this is generally what happens, that man just leaves me very unmotivated. Its like he is a constant reminder of what deep sadness and hatred looks like. Its like he wants to see me fail in all of my endeavors, and I really don't understand the reason as to why he would treat his son this way. I just want to do better and keep pushing, but he is a fucking drain that I cannot seem to get away from. I really just want to beat the fuck out of him and keep walking, but I know that is not the solution to the problem. All that would do is bring me back down to his level, and that's the last thing that I want to do. Its such a tedious and long battle with him

I cant help but feel bad for the man though, we are about to pull the rug out from underneath him and his comfy life. But the motherfucker has it coming with the way that he has treated me and mom, and everyone else is his awful fucking life. That motherfucker feeds on the awful parts of other peoples lives, How the fuck could you live like that, seeing only the bad and the dark in everything. 

He was telling what I do from within the Linux communities is a waste of time and there is no point in keeping going because it brings in no income and no actual value. I could care less about the value of what im doing in a monetary since as it actually brings me happiness and isnt yet another one of his money grubbing schemes.

I can definitely tell this note is angering me in particular today, I will keep that in mind and continue to push on even when days get hard like today. soon enough you wont have to deal with this, mom will come live with you and you can start your own family with her and James. Things might be tough right now, but you have been through far worse and overcame those issues. You can do the same with this issue. Its people like him that want to see you fail, and you cant give him the satisfaction of it.
