Well, this is it, This marks the day that I start turning my life together, From this day forward I am going to start writing at least 500 words a day in the hopes that it keeps me on a regular and normal structured learning path.

**Closing notes 

All in all, Just getting my life straightened out and running smoothly, The time is now to get life moving in the way that you want, Nobody will sit around and wait for you to start doing better, its on you, and only you.  You are 23 years old and need to start acting like it, no more needless spending and irresponsibility. You have a loving husband that only wants to see you do better and be happier. If not for you, Do it for him.

This will be the year that you truly find all the things you have been craving since you turned 18, Leaving your father and taking your mother with you, Understanding what it takes to be happy and stay happy, And not reading to deep into the things in front of you.

Stop feeling sorry for your self and start doing better, The support network is slowly fading and you need to stop relying on others to hold your hand for everything, You have all the tools in front of you, a loving community of friends and all the connections you can think of.

Quit being a bitch
