**notable software

Some of the more notable software created by the suck-less group are DWM, a Window manager focused on being small and easy to work with, The user is responsible for "patching" it there self, This includes making any changes to the software its self, even key-binds, You are essentially making new versions of DWM every-time you make a change to it 

There is also DMENU, which is a dynamic menu for the X system, Used for launching applications. It appears the user can also add a number of features to it as well.

and finally, ST, a terminal emulator, It appears that this is a deprecated project that the creators are not too fond of, they claim it has far too many lines of code for how simple a terminal emulator should be.

**General write up about suck-less software

after reading the philosophy of suck-less software, It becomes apparent they are targeting the "Power Users", The types of people that are very competent in there ability to use and navigate the F.O.S.S ecosystem and utilize it. They believe that software should be as simple as possible and do one thing at a time, not combine a multitude of features into one piece of software. With this thought process, it is believed that if we keep software simple and easy to use, maintenance and development become easier. This also plays into reliability as well.

After reading the manifest, I have come to the conclusion that they believe that the less lines of code there is in a piece of software, the better. Programmers shouldn't be proud of massive amounts of code, but they should be proud if they can make a piece of software have as little code as possible, just enough code to get the job done

**My opinion on the matter

I believe the suck-less mindset could lead us to great software, but after trying various suck-less software, I am not fully convinced it is a move in the correct direction. It feels hard to use and very minimal, Which is partially the goal, Minimal. The hard to use part, could be a issue on my end due to me misunderstanding how to use it. I will say, so far im not very impressed with suck-less software, but that seems to be the whole point, not to impress, but to be just usable enough to be considered software that functions.

For me, I believe I will be sticking with what they call "software that sucks", As most things that I use are full featured, for example. Hyprland the tiling window manager, Most believe it is very heavy for a tiling window manager, but I see it as a benefit, Everything works out of the box and is easy to configure. I have little to no problems with missing features or having to loads of research about it. Simply put, its easy.

Maybe in the future I could see my self trying out a suite of suck-less software, but at this current point, I dont fully see a point in doing it. I could see the point for users that are on slow or older hardware with less system horsepower to spare. But for most people, "software that sucks" is just fine and gets the job done.
